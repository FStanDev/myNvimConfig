# My Nvim configuration

Initialy this was my [nvchad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) configuration, but on v2.5 there were some changes that break my configuration and piss me off so I decided to make my own nvim configuration, to be as simple as possible for my needs, and leave it plublic if anyone wants to replicate it.

I donÂ´t believe the v2.5 change was wrong, it was just a change and IÂ´m still very grateful to Siduck for the amazing tool he made, and some configs are direct copies from their repo, like NvimTree configuration.

IÂ´ll add more configuration as I need it.

## Config Structure

### Base

On base folder you will find the core configuration of nvim, like lazy installation and basic remappings.

### Configs

On configs folder you will find specific configuraton for each plugin of my setup.

## Prerequisites

Nvim >= [0.9.5](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.9.5) (IÂ´m currently using [0.10.3](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.10.3))

[Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is optional but highly recommended

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) min version 18. This is for some lsp languages

## Installation

### On Mac/Linux:

Delete or backup old nvim folder just in case. Below commands shows how to delete old configuration

```

```
